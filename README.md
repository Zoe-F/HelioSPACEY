# Virtual Spacecraft Timeseries Analysis (VISTA)

This project will consist of the work undertaken during the course of a young graduate trainee (YGT) programme for
heliophysics research using machine learning (ML) methods at the European Space Agency (ESA). The objective of this
project is to define a set of criteria for the identification of conjunctions in data from the Solar Orbiter (SO) mission,
the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and the BepiColombo mission using a set of virtual spacecrafts (observation points) in a
whole-heliosphere 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and a "physics-informed" neural network to identify events
which may have been omitted by classical methods. 

The current contributors to this project are: Zoe Faes, Laura Hayes, Daniel MÃ¼ller and Andrew Walsh.
